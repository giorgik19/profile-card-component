## Overview

In this challenge we had to build a new profile card component

## My process

Coding process on this project was fun. I did a very good job on a card to look very much like an original. It wasn't hard but it obviously took some time. I used a lot of my knowledge, practiced a lot and in the end the project turned out fine.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [VS Studio](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### What I learned

I knew most of the HTML & CSS which were needed for this project to be built but again I also learned some background properties and practiced with it a lot.

### Continued development

I really want to learn and master more HTML & CSS for now, so i'm looking forward to the new challenges.
